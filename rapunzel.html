        <p>
            When Rapunzel is stuck in the tower, 
            the prince visits her at night and gives her a small silk handkerchief each night which she can sew into a long rope ladder.
            They also have sexual relations and Rapunzel is pregnant. 
            The wicked witch discovers her secret when she accidentally asks the witch why her dress suddenly feels 
            tight around the middle. In anger, she cuts off Rapunzel's hair and casts her off into the wilderness.
            Meanwhile, when the prince comes to visit her that night, the witch hauls him up using the severed hair. 
            He is shocked to see the witch and jumps out of the window. The thorns below prick his eyes and he goes blind.
            He roams the wasteland and finally, comes upon Rapunzel who is the mother of his children. 
            They reunite and when he cries, his eyes are automatically healed. Yes, magic.
