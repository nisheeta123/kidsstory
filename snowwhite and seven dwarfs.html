        <h1>SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS</h1>
        <p>
            The evil queen who is jealous of Snow White's beauty orders a huntsman to take her to the woods and to kill her.
             She orders him to return with her lungs and liver so that she can relish it. Instead, 
             the huntsman spares Snow White and brings the queen the lungs and liver of a boar. Snow White meanwhile
             reaches the home of the dwarfs and they let her stay if she cooks and cleans and keeps the house for them. 
             The next day, the queen discovers the huntsman's deceit as the mirror still proclaims Snow White the fairest. 
             The queen visits the home of the dwarfs disguised and tries to sell Snow White a lace bodice. 
             She ties the laces so tight that Snow White faints. The queen thinks her dead and departs. 
             The dwarfs come and revive her. The story repeats the second day when the queen uses a poison laced comb 
             to comb her hair but again she is saved by the dwarfs. The queen then gives Snow White the poison laced apple. 
             As soon as she bites the apple, she falls into a death like stupor.
             The dwarfs thinking her to be dead place her in a glass coffin.
            Soon, a prince passes by and is enchanted by her. 
            He orders his servants to take the glass coffin away and the dwarfs agree. When they are carrying the coffin,
            they stumble on some roots, the coffin falls and the piece of apple in 
            Snow White's throat is dislodged (because slow metabolism, FTW) and she wakes up.
            The prince is delighted and they get ready for marriage. The evil queen is invited too. 
            Since she does not know it is Snow White the prince is getting married to, she visit them. 
            Snow White reveals all the evil done by her. As punishment of her crimes, glowing-hot iron shoes are brought
            before her and she is ordered to wear them and dance till she drops dead. Well, torture rules!
