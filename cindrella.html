        <h1>CINDRELLA</h1>
            <p>  
                Cinderella by The Grimm Brothers is as grim as can get.
                According to the original story, Cinderella cries under a hazel tree she planted over her
                mother's grave and a white dove comes to comfort her. 
                During the ball, when her step-mother and step-sisters depart, 
                it is not a fairy but the white dove that drops the dress and shoes for her. 
                The ball was a three-night affair, not one night. The first night, Cinderella wears silk slippers;
                glass slippers the next and gold slippers the third night. 
                It is this gold slipper that the prince finds.
                When he visits every maiden in town, Cinderella's eldest sister cuts off her toes to fit her feet into the glass slipper.
                The prince is dumb enough to not notice it and is informed of it by the doves.
                He rushes back and this time, the second sister cuts off her heel to fit her foot in! Once again, 
                he misses it and the doves inform him. 
                We're wondering at this stage if he really deserved being king with his awesome observational powers!. 
                Finally, he finds Cinderella (thank the doves) and they get married. But wait, the gore continues. 
                At the wedding, Cinderella's sisters try to win her over but the doves fly down and peck both their eyes out, making them blind. 
                So now, they're lame and blind. Cinderella and Prince Daft continue ruling the kingdom. 
                So much for happy endings! ⭐️
