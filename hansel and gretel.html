        <h1>HANSEL AND GRETEL</h1>
           <p>
                According to the Grimm Brother's tale, Hansel and Gretel are the brother and sister pair whose 
                step-mother decides to leave them in the forest when there is a famine. 
                Her main purpose is that they get lost and the family has enough to eat. 
                They overhear their step-mother and gather white pebbles that they strew to find their way back. 
                The step-mom casts them out a second time and this time they aren't so lucky. T
                hey keep roaming and reach a witch's house made of gingerbread and cake
                (the ONLY part in the story where you don't want to puke). 
                The witch is a cannibal who eats children who cross her way. 
                She intends to eat Hansel and Gretel too. However, they outsmart her and burn her alive in her oven. 
                There. A child's tale full of cannibalism, child murdering mothers and witch burning children.
