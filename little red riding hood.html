        <h1>LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD</h1>
        <p>
            After the wolf eats the grandmother,
            he leaves some of her meat and blood that he cooks and offers to Little Red Riding Hood.
            So basically, she eats her own grandmother. She is then ordered by the wolf 
            (in the grandmother's disguise) to throw her clothes in the fire and come and lie besides him. 
            When Little Red Riding Hood realises it is the wolf and that he will eat her,
            she makes an excuse and says she needs to go and poop. The wolf ties a string to her leg so she cannot escape 
            but Little Red Riding Hood reties the string to an object and escapes. Hey, don't be scandalized. 
            It's a happy ending after all!
