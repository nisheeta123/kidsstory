        <h1>THE LITTLE MERMAID</h1>
        <p>
            Probably the saddest of the lot.
            The Little Mermaid lives in an underwater kingdom with her father, grandmother and sisters. 
            Every year, post their 15th birthday, the sisters can take turns once a year to visit the surface and see the world outside.
            Once the Little Mermaid's turn comes, 
            she rises to the surface and witnesses a shipwreck. 
            She saves the prince from drowning and promptly falls in love with him.
            The prince however, is unconscious and when The Little Mermaid leaves him ashore on the steps of a temple,
            a young girl comes out from the temple and the prince thinks it is the girl who saves him. 
            The Little Mermaid is sad but goes back to the sea. 
            She then visits a mermaid witch who agrees to give her a potion which will change her tail to feet.
            However, she must part with her tongue. 
            She will be the best dancer in the world but her feet will feel as if they are being pricked by glass
            shards every minute and as if her toes are bleeding. Also, she will get a human soul only if the prince
            loves her and marries her. Otherwise, she will turn to sea-foam. The Little Mermaid agrees.

             She reaches the shore and drinks the potion and now has 2 feet.
            She is found by the prince and he is mesmerised by her beauty. They become fast friends and she accompanies him
            everywhere and dances for him. One day, the king announces that he has arranged for the 
            prince to marry a princess from the neighbouring kingdom. The prince then reveals to The Little 
            Mermaid that he loves the girl from the temple as he thinks she saved him. By a twist of fate, the princess 
            he is destined to marry is the same girl. She was visiting the temple that day when she saw the prince. 
            They get married and The Little Mermaid is heart-broken. When she is about to turn into sea-foam, 
            her sisters come to her with a dagger. They tell her she must stab the prince and let his blood flow over her feet.
            She will then get back her tail and become a mermaid again. 
            She goes to kill the prince but cannot as she truly loves him. 
            Instead, she falls into the sea and dissolves not into sea-form but becomes one with the atmosphere as a
            reward for her true love. If she serves humanity for another 300 years, she will rise to the higher realms. Sigh.
            So much for true love.
