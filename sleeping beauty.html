        <h1>SLEEPING BEAUTY</h1>
        <p>
        Once again, this story has 2 versions. 
        In the first version, everything is nice and happy and the princess wakes up when the prince kisses her.
        But that's not the end. This prince has an ogre for a mother. 
        Now, he knows his mother will never accept the princess (Jocasta complex perhaps?) and he carries on his affair in secret. 
        The princess has borne him a son and a daughter. When the time for the prince to ascend the throne arrives, 
        he brings his family to the castle. The ogre mother banishes the princess and the children to the forest and 
        orders the cook to cook them and serve them to her as luncheon. On day one, the cook replaces the boy with a lamb;,
        the girl is replaced by goat meat on day two. The ogre never realises the difference. On day three, 
        the princess who is heart-broken over her children's death offers to slit her throat. 
        But the cook reunites her with her children and serves the ogre red deer or hind cooked in Sauce Robert. 
        The ogre soon finds out she's been tricked and prepares a tub filled with vipers and foul creatures.
        However, before she can punish the cook, the princess and the children, 
        the prince arrives (no one knows why he disappeared for 3 whole days) and the ogre throws herself in the tub and is consumed. 
        If that wasn't gory enough, in version 2, it is not a prince but an already married king that visits the sleeping princess. 
        He finds her alive and unconscious and well, even in that state she somehow arouses him. He rapes her and leaves. 
        Raped by the king, she is now pregnant and delivers twins all the while sleeping.
        Her little son sucks on her finger and finally she awakens as he sucks the spindle's poison out (he survives though.
        Guess it had to be injected not ingested). She awakens and is confused on seeing her two children.
        She begins to care for them. One day, the lecherous king is in the mood for some more somnophilia and visits the princess. 
        She's awake though and like a true "aadarsh nari" forgives the king and accepts him. 
        He stays for a few days and then goes back to his kingdom. 
        His wife however, suspects something amiss and realises the king has been happily sleeping around.
        Infuriated, she asks Sleeping Beauty's children to be brought to the castle and be cooked. 
        However, the cook saves the day and hides the kids. 
        She then orders Sleeping Beauty be brought herself and burnt alive. 
        (nice again, the king is missing from the scenario). 
        He saves Sleeping Beauty and burns his queen instead. They then marry and live happily ever after.
        Or at least till the king goes a-raping once more.
